## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User enters their **name** and **account number**.
2. Based on the entered account number, a **predefined balance** is assigned.
3. The system then displays a menu that includes:

   * Deposit
   * Withdraw
   * Check Balance
   * Exit
4. All operations update the balance in real-time.

## 📋 Example Workflow

1. User enters: `John`, `12345`
2. System assigns balance: `23410`
3. User selects an option from the menu
4. System performs the action and returns updated status
5. User may continue or exit
